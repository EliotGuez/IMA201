# IMA201
Repository dedicated to the projects of Introduction to image processing course, Télécom-Paris 2023/2024. 

You can find the project I worked on for 3 months with Zohra Benali about transferring color from an image to another by using 3D sliced transport, and some regularization filter.   

You can also find some Practical work I work on and a pdf with answer to numerous questions about the course ima201 useful to prepare the exam.
